  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>Hello! My name is Dennis, I am only writing this because its my official first project and I want to be able to see my progress, 
    or lack of there of by using this as a first time start. It is quite interesting to think how fast time will past after I complete writing this. 
    I hope that by the time I can look at these simple things and laugh, I will also be showing my wife in the same room and house as me. Hey love! 
  </p>
  <p> As of now, I work at Geek Squad as an Advanced Repair Agent. While I am a part time, I have ambitions of a promotion to a full-time position. 
    This way, I will be able to better support not only myself and my family but become a leader at Geek Squad. Thus far, 
    I've been taking on more responsiblilities in my daily duties, and find the challenge of learning something new quite fun.
  </p>
